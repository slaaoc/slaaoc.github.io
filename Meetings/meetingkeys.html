<h3>Meeting Format Definitions</h3>

<p>The meeting format definitions below describe key characteristics of the meetings that establish 
the focus for participation.&nbsp; 
The described format will typically only use 10 - 15 minutes.&nbsp; 
The rest of the time is for sharing.&nbsp; While attendees are typically 
encouraged to share how they relate to the readings, they are welcome to share on 
other topics.
<br><br>
Each meeting is free to choose its own format and how it applies to the way the meeting is run.&nbsp; 
This is usually described at the beginning of the meeting by the meeting leader.
<br><br>
Most meetings have a certain amount of flexibility so that as many as possible can share.</p>
